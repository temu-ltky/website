Techmu is a part of TeMu focused in electronic music and the culture surrounding it, founded in 1997.

The main goal of Techmu is to increase knowledge of electronic music and culture among students to the people interested in the subject. Along the years beginners and more experienced old troupers have joined the action. Initial skills don’t matter, you’ll learn things along the way. The most important thing is to enjoy music and making it great together.

Techmu organizes many events during the year, welcome to the party! Joining as a member is highly recommended and affordable. You’ll join in Techmu activites by first joining as a member of TeMu and expressing interest in Techmu activites by writing it in the membership application form.

We’ll gladly teach the ropes of the DJ-equipment to new members.
